This is a trial run of an upcoming data analysis project. Made-up data is being used.
**Research Question**: Do people who use AI more come from higher parental income families, have lower academic scores, worse social skills, and use digital social media platforms more?

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

```

# Research Design
Survey, Questionnaire.  
Population: Young Chinese people (18-25)  
Sample Size: Approximately 50 (convenience or self-selecting)

# Variables
- **Dependent variable**: AI use (frequency of use)  
- **Independent variables**:
  1. Academic performance (self-reported grades)  
  2. Parental income (categorical income ranges)  
  3. Social interaction skills (composite score from multiple Likert scale questions)  
  4. Social media exposure (frequency or duration of social media use)

# Hypotheses
- **H1**: Lower academic performance is associated with higher AI use.  
- **H2**: Higher parental income is associated with higher AI use.  
- **H3**: Worse social interaction skills are associated with higher AI use.  
- **H4**: Higher social media exposure is associated with higher AI use.
